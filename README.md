### Hi, my name is Ben ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2022 with a degree in knowledge integration. In the last years of my degree, I learned how to use Python programming for web-scraping and data analysis tasks in context of academic research. Since then, I've been self-studying Linux ops, cloud infrastructure, and network-distributed computer systems. Most recently I finished a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) at the end of 2022, and I'm currently looking for work.
